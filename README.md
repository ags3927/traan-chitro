Notes and Conventions
- 
&nbsp;  
Branch Naming:
* Frontend branches - "frontend-NAME" - replace 'NAME' with the intended branch name
* Backend branches - "backend-NAME" - replace 'NAME' with the intended branch name

&nbsp;  
Branch Usage Rules:
* DO NOT push to "master" under any circumstance
* Once you have completed work on your branch, make a pull request and we will merge the branch together
* Try not to work on the same files concurrently with another person

&nbsp;  
Tips To Avoid Conflicts: 
* When you start working on a file, add a comment to the top of the file - "LOCKED BY - [YOUR NAME]"
* Then make a commit with the message - ":lock: File lock commit"
* When you finish working on a file and want to withdraw the lock, remove the comment from the top of the file
* Then make a commit with the message - ":unlock: File unlock commit"
* If you don't know how to add those little lock and unlock emojis at the beginning of the message, refer to the <b>General Tips</b> section below this
